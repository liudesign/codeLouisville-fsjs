Detailed steps on how to start the application and any prerequisites to run it. For example, if your project requires using a package manager like NPM, you must include any requirements needed to run it and the steps needed to view and get started using. An example of what notes you might include in your readme for a locally run project:
Go to root directory of project
Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
Run ‘mongod’ to start mongo service
Run ‘npm start’ to begin the app server process
Open a localhost windows to the port it’s running on
